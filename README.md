# Earth Keepers: Gamified Trash Collection App
**Problem:** The increasing prevalence of uncollected trash in public spaces poses a serious environmental threat.

**Solution:** Earth Keepers is a machine learning-powered mobile app that redefines waste collection through a fun, engaging, and gamified experience. The app uses a body camera to detect and categorize trash in real-time, rewarding users with points for each item collected.

Key Features:

**YOLOv8** for Object Detection: Accurately identifies trash using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
**MediaPipe** Hand Tracking: Recognizes hand gestures for grabbing trash, enhancing user interactivity.
Gamification: Users earn points based on the trash items collected, making the process enjoyable and rewarding.
Target Audience: Environmentally conscious individuals motivated to participate in trash collection efforts.

Verification:

Comprehensive testing of hand detection, trash recognition, item counting, and system performance.
User feedback to assess the appâ€™s efficiency and ease of use.
Impact: This project aims to reduce uncollected trash in public spaces, promote environmental awareness, and foster community-driven initiatives for a cleaner future.
